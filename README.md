# Network Diagrams for Connectivity options between Hub-and-Spoke and Azure Virtual WAN

## Intro

This repository contains network diagrams that illustrate various connectivity options between Hub-and-Spoke architectures and Azure Virtual WAN, based on the blog post: [Connectivity options between Hub-and-Spoke and Azure Virtual WAN](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurenetworkingblog/connectivity-options-between-hub-and-spoke-and-azure-virtual-wan/4437383).

The diagrams are designed to help visualize different scenarios and configurations for network connectivity in Azure.

There are few options here to consume those diagrams:

1. Download the diagrams directly from the repository in Excalidraw format
2. Fork this repo and open the diagram on Visual Studio Code with the [Excalidraw extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) installed as shown:
