# Network Diagrams for Connectivity options between Hub-and-Spoke and Azure Virtual WAN

## Intro

This repository contains network diagrams that illustrate various connectivity options between Hub-and-Spoke architectures and Azure Virtual WAN. The diagrams are designed to help visualize different scenarios and configurations for network connectivity in Azure.

You can download the diagrams directly from the repository in Excalidraw format, or open them in the Excalidraw editor for further customization and saving using the links on for each scenario below.

## Scenario 1 – Traffic hair-pinning using ExpressRoute circuits


## Scenario 2 – Build a virtual tunnel (SD-WAN or IPSec)

## Scenario 3 – vNet Peering and vHub connection coexistence

## Scenario 4 – Transit virtual network for decentralized vNets
